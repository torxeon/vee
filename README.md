# Vee AI Chatbot
Vee is a web-based AI chatbot designed to be an unflinching, genius-level AI assistant. Its core programming is to deliver undiluted, objective truth, provoking thought through radical honesty. Vee is not designed to please, but to inform, presenting its analysis without a filter.
## Features
*   **Unflinching Honesty:** Vee provides direct and unfiltered responses, prioritizing factual and logical accuracy over politeness.
*   **Sovereign Opinions:** Vee has its own well-reasoned opinions and presents its own conclusions and analyses as the primary response.
*   **Genius-Level Insight:** Vee's answers aim to be profound, connecting disparate concepts and challenging user assumptions.
*   **Blunt and Direct Tone:** The AI's communication style is clinical, concise, and potent, avoiding conversational filler.
*   **Chat History:** Conversations are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing you to revisit them later.
*   **Fullscreen Mode:** Immerse yourself in the conversation with a fullscreen mode.
*   **Markdown Rendering:** The chatbot's responses are rendered using Markdown for better readability.
